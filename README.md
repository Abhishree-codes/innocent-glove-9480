1. Project's Title:
This is an HTML & CSS project with a bit of JavaScript. It is a clone of the caratlane Webpage.

2. Project Description:
Caratlane is an e-commerce website that sells jewelery made of various types of precious metals. I named my clone site Aurum jewels as the symbol for gold (Au) comes from the Latin â€˜aurum', as I noticed their site has mostly gold jewelery and I wanted the name I picked to highlight that.

3. Functionalities implemented:
-Register Page:
Takes user data and stores it in local storage to be used.
Doesn't allow same email to be registered.
I implemented password requirements.
Asks for OTP and verifies with the OTP stored in LS.
Option to redirect to login.

-Login Pages:
Check for correct details with the respect to LS and redirect to home page.

Categories on the nav bar redirect to product page and show only products belonging to that category.
