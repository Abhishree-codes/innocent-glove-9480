# Project Title
Caratlane is an e-commerce website that sells jewelery made of various types of precious metals. 

# Project Description
This is an HTML & CSS project with a bit of JavaScript. It is a clone of the caratlane website. I named my clone site Aurum jewels as the symbol for gold (Au) comes from the Latin â€˜aurum', as I noticed their site has mostly gold jewelery and I wanted the name I picked to highlight that.
